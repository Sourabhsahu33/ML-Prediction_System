            <p>1. Lose extra weight
                Losing weight reduces the risk of diabetes. People in one large study reduced their risk of developing
                diabetes by almost 60% after losing approximately 7% of their body weight with changes in exercise and
                diet.

                The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with prediabetes lose at least 7% to 10% of
                their body weight to prevent disease progression. More weight loss will translate into even greater
                benefits.

                Set a weight-loss goal based on your current body weight. Talk to your doctor about reasonable
                short-term goals and expectations, such as a losing 1 to 2 pounds a week.
            </p> <br>

            <p> 2. Be more physically active
                There are many benefits to regular physical activity. Exercise can help you:

                Lose weight
                Lower your blood sugar
                Boost your sensitivity to insulin — which helps keep your blood sugar within a normal range
                Goals for most adults to promote weight loss and maintain a healthy weight include:

                Aerobic exercise. Aim for 30 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise — such as brisk
                walking, swimming, biking or running — on most days for a total of at least 150 minutes a week.
                Resistance exercise. Resistance exercise — at least 2 to 3 times a week — increases your strength,
                balance and ability to maintain an active life. Resistance training includes weightlifting, yoga and
                calisthenics.
                Limited inactivity. Breaking up long bouts of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help
                control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30
                minutes.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                3. Eat healthy plant foods
                Plants provide vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates in your diet. Carbohydrates include sugars and
                starches — the energy sources for your body — and fiber. Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk,
                is the part of plant foods your body can't digest or absorb.

                Fiber-rich foods promote weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes. Eat a variety of healthy,
                fiber-rich foods, which include:

                Fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and fruit from trees
                Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, broccoli and cauliflower
                Legumes, such as beans, chickpeas and lentils
                Whole grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, whole-grain rice, whole oats, and quinoa
                The benefits of fiber include:

                Slowing the absorption of sugars and lowering blood sugar levels
                Interfering with the absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol
                Managing other risk factors that affect heart health, such as blood pressure and inflammation
                Helping you eat less because fiber-rich foods are more filling and energy rich
                Avoid foods that are "bad carbohydrates" — high in sugar with little fiber or nutrients: white bread and
                pastries, pasta from white flour, fruit juices, and processed foods with sugar or high-fructose corn
                syrup.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>4. Eat healthy fats
                Fatty foods are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. To help lose and manage weight, your
                diet should include a variety of foods with unsaturated fats, sometimes called "good fats."

                Unsaturated fats — both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — promote healthy blood cholesterol
                levels and good heart and vascular health. Sources of good fats include:

                Olive, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed and canola oils
                Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, peanuts, flaxseed and pumpkin seeds
                Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna and cod
                Saturated fats, the "bad fats," are found in dairy products and meats. These should be a small part of
                your diet. You can limit saturated fats by eating low-fat dairy products and lean chicken and pork.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 5. Skip fad diets and make healthier choices
                Many fad diets — such as the glycemic index, paleo or keto diets — may help you lose weight. There is
                little research, however, about the long-term benefits of these diets or their benefit in preventing
                diabetes.

                Your dietary goal should be to lose weight and then maintain a healthier weight moving forward. Healthy
                dietary decisions, therefore, need to include a strategy that you can maintain as a lifelong habit.
                Making healthy decisions that reflect some of your own preferences for food and traditions may be
                beneficial for you over time.

                One simple strategy to help you make good food choices and eat appropriate portions sizes is to divide
                up your plate. These three divisions on your plate promote healthy eating:

                One-half: fruit and nonstarchy vegetables
                One-quarter: whole grains
                One-quarter: protein-rich foods, such as legumes, fish or lean meats</p>
